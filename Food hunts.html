                            Andhra Pradesh is the leading producer of red chili and rice among Indian states, and Telangana the leading producer of millet; this influences the liberal use of spices in Telugu cuisine, making its food some of the richest and spiciest in the world. Vegetarian, as well as meat and seafood (coastal areas), feature prominently on the menus. Pappu, tomato, gongura, and tamarind are largely used for cooking curries. Spicy and hot varieties of pickles form an important part of Telugu cuisine.

Vegan diets are based on grains, seeds, nuts, legumes, soy, fruits, vegetables, and oils. A lacto-vegetarian eats dairy products in addition to the vegan diet.
